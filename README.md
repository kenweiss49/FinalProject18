My game is a simple soccer penalty shootout game. You choose your team and the
computer is a randomly generated team. You are given 3 directions to shoot/dive
to try and score a point/prevent an opponent point. You play 5 rounds as the
shooter and 5 rounds as the goalie. Whoever (you or the computer) has more
points by the end of the 5 rounds (10 total actions) wins. The game has some
fun little extras to make it more entertaining. There is "dramatic timing" for
all of the shots and dives. I also added commentary/comments to add to the
excitement of the gameplay.
